#MY TOUR OF THE LINUX SYSTEM
#Written by Ning Yufeng 
##chapter 1
###This chapter tells how to run the LINUX system in your computer,including some errors that the beginners always make. 
###There are two ways to run this system in your computer.One is using the  [VMware Workstation](http://www.epinv.com/post/6304.html) to create a virtual computer to provide the basic environment for LINUX.The other is loading LINUX system directly in your real computer.I choose the former because it is safer.(Actually both have the advantages and disadvantages.The former way is safer,but operating speed may be lower.)Then,I will introduce the steps briefly.
####step 1:copy the basic software from the computers in the class(VMware Workstation,Ubuntu etc.)
####step 2:install VMware Workstation.Then open the file,copy the activation code,paste it in the software to activate it.
####step 3:use the instilled software to create a virtual computer,then choose the system you want to run in this computer.OK,now you can enjoy the world of linux!
###Tips:In the beginning,you may be unable to have a full-screen view of this system.Never mind,reinstall [VMware Tools](http://jingyan.baidu.com/article/f7ff0bfc13d02f2e26bb13af.html) and everything would be OK.
